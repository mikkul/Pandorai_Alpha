# Pandorai

Pandorai is a [traditional roguelike](http://roguebasin.com/index.php/Main_Page) that I've been developing since summer 2020. It features a [procedurally generated](#map-generation) world with 10 unique [regions](https://github.com/mikkul/Pandorai_Alpha/wiki/Regions), 34 different items and 15 different types of AI-controlled creatures. All this paired with custom graphics, particle systems, 9 soundtracks and almost a hundred sounds to give the game a unique feel. I worked on it for 6 months or so, then stopped for a long time and returned to development in 2022. It gave me a lot of challenges and taught me a lot. I think making games is a great way to learn and improve your knowledge in programming in any language.

## Technical details

Made with .NET 5.0. I used [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) (successor of XNA) as the main framework and [Myra](https://github.com/rds1983/Myra) for the UI. Additionaly used [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) for JSON serialization and [DeBroglie](https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/DeBroglie) as the WFC (Wave Function Collapse) algorithm implementation.
