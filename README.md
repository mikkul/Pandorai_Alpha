# Pandorai

Pandorai is a [traditional roguelike](http://roguebasin.com/index.php/Main_Page) that I've been developing since summer 2020. I worked on it for 6 months or so, then stopped for a long time and returned to development in 2022. It gave me a lot of challenges and taught me a lot. I think making games is a great way to learn and improve your knowledge in programming in any language.
